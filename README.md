# KindeReady

_We help pre-school scholars get ready for Kindergarten._

**KindeReady** is a web-based application, geared toward preparing students for entry into kindergarten. Through, both, teacher led and student driven activities, an adequate assessment can be made to determine the student readiness for advancement in their educational career.

The app is comprised of _Units_, which are each based on the 9 milestones in early childhood development and kindergarten preparation. Each unit contains 3 _Activities_ and a _Summary_ for the students' learning. Students progress will be tracked and stored in their profile and _Units_ & _Activities_ can be revisited for supplemental learning, at **any time**!
